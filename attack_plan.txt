1) Everybody is reading instructions - 10-15 min
2) Discussion of the task, tackle simple problem, make sure we understand instructions. 
   Decide on "internal" format for problem data (input) and solution data (output).
3) Split to work:
   a) read: input file -> memory
   b) write: solution (partial) -> output file
   c) validation, scoring of (partial) solution
   d) fast-and-dirty implementation of solution (input data -> solution)
   e) try to submit simple solution, check scoring
4) Discussion:
   a) analyze input examples (may have different tactics for different inputs)
   b) promissing strategies
   c) decide what to focus on
5) Implementation. 
   Submit improved solutions to all problems.
6) Brainstorm how to improve even further, and so on.
